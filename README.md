## Why GNU/Linux?
First of all, it must be said that GNU/Linux isn't a *"free alternative to Windows"* but it is actually a solution for a free (as in freedom) computing; because your machine is only yours and nobody but the user has the right to have control over it.  
Proprietary operating systems don't give this freedom to the user, in fact, any computer running Windows or macOS are Microsoft/Apple computers:  
they decide when it's time to update, what software use, what features add or remove. Corporations control over people's computer doesn't stop there. Because we live in the age of [mass surveilance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance) our activities are constantly monitored, every program we have installed, every keystroke, every file, our microphones and cameras, everything is recorded and cloned into corporated servers.
GNU/Linux is the solution to all of this, to a free computing experience where the user decides what to do with its system, a system that *leaves you alone.*

But what makes GNU/Linux **free**? It's simple: the license.   
The OS and all its components are *free as in freedom* which means the source code is available to the public so everybody can study, modify and re-distribute the software by using the [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) or [GPL-compatible](http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/Compatible_licenses) license.

## Distributions
So you decided to join the land of freedom but don't know where to start, but don't worry, this guide got you covered!  
Linux comes by many "versions" of the OS which are generally called "distro(s)" or "flavor(s)" and there are many of them, but if you're a beginner is recommended to stick with easy to use distros, otherwise there is also a list of more complex distros, it's all about choice!

### User-Friendly Distros
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/): simply the most used distribution, if you don't know what distro install Ubuntu got you covered.
- [Pop!OS](https://pop.system76.com/): Ubuntu-based distro with more up-to-date packages and a vanilla GNOME workflow.
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com): another Ubuntu-based distro with the focus on simplicity and UI familiarity.
- [Debian](https://debian.org): the mother of 90% of all distros, definetely recommended if you want a pure and stable distro.
- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org): mantained by the community, focused on innovation with the latest technologies for Linux.
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/): based on Arch Linux, this distro has the most bleeding edge software even though it's not that stable.
- [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/): an indipendent distro focused on simplicity and OOTB experience with a pretty interface.
